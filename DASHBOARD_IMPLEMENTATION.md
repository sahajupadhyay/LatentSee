## 🎯 **Testing the Dashboard**

### **How to Use:**
1. **Start the application**: `npm run dev` (running on port 3002)
2. **Navigate to dashboard**: Click "Get Started" or go to `/#execution-section`
3. **Test API endpoints**: Click on any consistency model card (Neural Authority, Neural Cache, Smart Memory)
4. **Watch real-time updates**: See charts populate with live performance data
5. **Export research data**: Use the Data Export component for academic analysis

### **Expected Behavior:**
- **Charts populate immediately** after first API test
- **Real-time updates** with each subsequent test
- **Time range filtering** works across all components
- **Model filtering** shows/hides specific consistency models
- **Export functions** download CSV/JSON files with comprehensive data
