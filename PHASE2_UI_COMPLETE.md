## Technical Achievements

### 1. **Seamless Data Integration**
```typescript
// Automatic conversion from ExecutionPage metrics to AI format
const aiMetric = createAIMetricFromExecution(
  mode as 'Neural Authority' | 'Neural Cache' | 'Smart Memory',
  endpoint,
  responseTime,
  cacheMetrics,
  dataCount,
  errorOccurred
);
```

### 2. **Smart State Management**
- AI metrics automatically collected during normal testing workflow
- Budget status computed reactively based on usage
- Modal state management with proper cleanup

### 3. **Intelligent UI Logic**
```typescript
// Dynamic button text based on context
const aiButtonConfig = useMemo(() => {
  return getAIAnalysisButtonText(state.aiMetrics.length, budgetStatus);
}, [state.aiMetrics.length, budgetStatus]);
```

### 4. **Error Resilience**
- Fallback to sample insights when AI is unavailable
- Graceful degradation when budget is exceeded
- Proper error boundaries and user feedback

## User Journey Enhancement
