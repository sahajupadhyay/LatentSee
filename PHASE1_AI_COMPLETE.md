  - Complete TypeScript interfaces for all AI functionality
  - Performance metrics, analysis results, insights, recommendations
  - Cache optimization results and consistency model types
  - Comprehensive type safety for all AI operations

## Key Features Implemented

### Genuine AI-Powered Analysis
- **Performance Pattern Recognition**: Uses OpenAI to identify complex performance patterns that rule-based systems cannot detect
- **Intelligent Insights**: Generates contextual insights about cache performance, consistency trade-offs, and optimization opportunities  
- **Smart Recommendations**: Provides actionable recommendations with implementation complexity estimates and expected improvements

### Cost Optimization
- **Budget Controls**: Strict $5 budget limit with real-time monitoring
- **Cost-Effective Model**: Uses gpt-4o-mini for optimal cost/performance ratio
- **Token Optimization**: Conservative token limits and efficient prompt engineering
- **Usage Analytics**: Detailed cost breakdown by operation type and model

### Fallback Systems
- **Graceful Degradation**: All AI features have rule-based fallbacks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful fallbacks
- **Availability Checks**: Smart detection of AI service availability

### Performance & Reliability
- **Caching**: 5-minute TTL caching to reduce API calls
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanisms for API failures
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict typing

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Replaced Misleading Terminology
- **Before**: "Neural Authority", "Neural Cache", "Smart Memory" (just basic database queries)
- **After**: Genuine AI analysis of consistency models with real performance insights

### 2. Added Real Intelligence
- **Pattern Detection**: AI identifies subtle performance patterns and anomalies
- **Contextual Analysis**: Considers workload types, user preferences, and performance requirements
- **Predictive Insights**: Forecasts performance trends and potential issues

### 3. Built Production-Ready Infrastructure
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design supporting easy extension
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- **Budget Management**: Built-in cost controls and monitoring
- **Monitoring**: Detailed logging and usage analytics

## Usage Examples

### Performance Analysis
```typescript
import { aiService } from '@/lib/ai';

// Get AI-powered performance analysis
const analysis = await aiService.analyzePerformance(metrics, {
  analysisType: 'detailed',
  includePatterns: true,
  includeAnomalies: true
});

console.log(`Found ${analysis.insights.length} insights`);
console.log(`Generated ${analysis.recommendations.length} recommendations`);
```

### Cache Optimization
```typescript
import { cacheOptimizer } from '@/lib/ai/cache-optimizer';

// Get optimal consistency model recommendation
const recommendation = cacheOptimizer.getOptimalConsistencyModel(metrics, {
  maxAcceptableLatency: 500,
  minRequiredConsistency: 'eventual',
  tolerateStaleData: true
});

console.log(`Recommended model: ${recommendation.recommendedModel}`);
console.log(`Confidence: ${recommendation.confidence * 100}%`);
```

### Budget Monitoring
```typescript
import { aiService } from '@/lib/ai';

// Check budget status
const budget = aiService.getBudgetStatus();
console.log(`Budget used: $${budget.used.toFixed(4)} / $${budget.limit}`);
console.log(`Status: ${budget.status}`);

// Check if operation is affordable
const affordability = aiService.canAffordOperation('gpt-4o-mini', {
  prompt: 800,
  completion: 400
});
console.log(`Can afford: ${affordability.canAfford}`);
```
